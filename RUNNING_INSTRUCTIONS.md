# CodeDuet Running Instructions

## âœ… Solution: Packaged Version Running

1. **Built the production package** with code signing disabled for development
2. **Successfully packaged** the Electron app to `out/CodeDuet-darwin-x64/CodeDuet.app`
3. **Launched the application** using `open` command

## How to run CodeDuet in the future:

### Option 1: Direct launch
```bash
open out/CodeDuet-darwin-x64/CodeDuet.app
```

### Option 2: Rebuild and launch
```bash
E2E_TEST_BUILD=true npm run package
open out/CodeDuet-darwin-x64/CodeDuet.app
```

## Key Points:

- The development mode (`npm start`) was hanging due to Node.js 21.6.1 compatibility issues
- The production build works fine and bypasses the development server issues
- The packaged app runs as a native macOS application without the preload script errors
- Code signing was disabled for development (using `E2E_TEST_BUILD=true`)

The CodeDuet application should now be running successfully on your system!

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Preload script errors**: Use the packaged version instead of development mode
2. **Node.js compatibility**: Consider switching to Node.js 20.x for development mode
3. **Code signing errors**: Always use `E2E_TEST_BUILD=true` when packaging for development

## Development Workflow

For active development, you can:
1. Make code changes
2. Rebuild with `E2E_TEST_BUILD=true npm run package`
3. Launch with `open out/CodeDuet-darwin-x64/CodeDuet.app`
